# PHP Sandbox

Due to new employement starting in January, I wanted to get a feel for PHP as they utilise it in house. So I'm following Traversy Media's [front-to-back course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfyzaA2QA&list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn) to gain knowledge and hopefully build something with it before starting my new job.

## Installation
Please install [XAMMP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
